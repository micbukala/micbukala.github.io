# Projects
<b> Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Momentum Programme](https://momentum.csic.es/en/momentum-program/) (CSIC, Spain) </b><br>
I am developing advanced numerical modeling tools to improve our understanding of volatile exchanges and redox reactions in the Earth’s deep interior under high-pressure and low-to-high-temperature conditions. This project focuses on efficiently integrating Gibbs free energy minimization (GFEM) with reactive transport models, leveraging AI techniques.<br><br>

Funding: <br> 
<b> Geodynamic Integration of Volatiles and Redox Exchanges </b><br>
Project Number: MMT24-IACT-01 ; CSIC-MOMENTUM SCHOLARSHIP funded EU’s Recovery and Resilience Mechanism – Next Generation, as part of the talent attraction and retention programs of Red.es, corresponding to Investment 4 of Component 19 of the Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Plan (PRTR).
