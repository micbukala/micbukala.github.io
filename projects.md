# Projects
<b> Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Momentum Programme](https://momentum.csic.es/en/momentum-program/) (CSIC, Spain) </b><br>
I am developing numerical modeling tools to improve our understanding of volatile exchanges and redox reactions in the Earth’s deep interior under high-pressure and low-to-high-temperature conditions. 
This project focuses on integrating Gibbs free energy minimization (GFEM) with reactive transport models, leveraging AI techniques.<br><br>
