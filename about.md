<b> Micha≈Ç Buka≈Ça, PhD</b> <br>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">[ENG: <i>Mee-how Boo-kah-lah</i>]</span> <br>

I really like mountains‚Äîthey're big and rocky.<br><br>
Also, I am a geologist specializing in fluid-rock interactions and the deformation processes occurring in environments ranging from the deep Earth to the near surface. My approach integrates hands-on fieldwork, laboratory studies, and advanced numerical/thermodynamic modeling to uncover the intricate dynamics of our planet.
