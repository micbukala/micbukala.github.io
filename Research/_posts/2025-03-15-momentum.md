<b> What's it about? </b> <br><br>
Earth shows how a planet’s internal geodynamics can strongly influence its outer layers —the atmosphere and oceans— affecting climate, habitability, and even the origin of life. 
This connection depends on how volatile elements (like COHNS, especially oxygen) move between the Earth's deep interior and surface. <br>

While Earth’s initial volatile inventory was set early in its formation, recent studies show that the current state of the atmosphere and hydrosphere results from a delicate balance between the release of volatiles and their return via subduction zones. These exchanges also affect how the Earth’s interior behaves mechanically. <br>

Understanding this feedback is a major scientific challenge, as it involves complex, evolving physical and chemical processes over different timescales and depths. Although geodynamic and thermodynamic modeling tools have improved, they still struggle to fully capture the impact of dehydration and melting on volatile transfer. <br>

This project aims to develop strategies to integrate fluid and melt thermodynamics—with changing oxidation states—into geodynamic models of subduction zones. It will explore how to connect thermo-mechanical models with systems where geochemical composition changes through deep chemical interactions. <br>
